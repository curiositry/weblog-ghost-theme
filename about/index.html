That’s right: not one line of JavaScript. This means no sneaky tracking. No analytics. No bling. Just words. Words that can be viewed on any device. Words that can be read on an Apple IIe. Words that can be read from command-line, text-based browsers. Words that will stand the test of time. </li><li> <strong>No comments</strong>. Say goodbye to flamewars at the end of every post, endless moderation queues, and bloated, tracking-laden third-party commenting engines.  </li><li> <strong>No multi-author posts.</strong> This theme is for you, sitting by yourself, writing words and putting them on the internet. Large-scale publications have nice themes to pick from; now solo bloggers have one made just for them. </li><li> <strong>No blurry, bandwidth-hogging stock photos of people in suits drawing on whiteboards.</strong> You can use images in your posts, but you don’t have to fill them up with unneccessary stock photos just so that your theme doesn’t break.  </li><li> <strong>No CSS preprocessors</strong>. Sass? Less?? Stylus??? Nope. Just plain old fast, reliable CSS. And not much of it, either. </li><li> <strong>No bloat.</strong> No pretty but ambiguous icons, no fancy fonts that slow down your blog. Your blog will be so fast people can read it over dialup or over a cellphone connection in a blizzard. Which is good, because the people reading it may not live in a coffee shop in San Francisco with blazing fast WiFi. </li></ul><hr><p>This doesn’t mean that weblog is backward.

Add and remove functionality without code-surgery. </li><li> <strong>Ready-to-roll with smart defaults.</strong>. It’s a car with gas in tank and air in the tires. Everything you’d expect from a Ghost theme is there. You get a homepage with an old fashioned list of posts, reasonable metadata below the title of each post, a little author bio at the end of each post, a menu with a list of links, a nice page for each tag, a polite email opt-in form, and more. </li><li> <strong>Cleanly coded and comprehensively commented</strong>. The code is nice and clean, and W3C valid. </li><li> <strong>Insanely fast.</strong> Weblog scores 98/100 on Google pagespeed. The homepage loads in milliseconds. This may be the fastest Ghost theme in the known universe. </li><li> <strong>Rugged beauty.</strong> Weblog has no bling, but the simple design has a rugged beauty of its own: the beauty of function. The beauty of something that has one job, but does it well. </li></ul><h1 id="weblog">weblog</h1><p>A Ghost theme that brings blogging back to its golden era</p><h2 id="-features--1">“Features”</h2><p>What makes the weblog theme special isn’t the features it has, but the unecessary features it <em>doesn’t</em> have.</p><ul><li> <strong>No JavaScript</strong>.
