Say goodbye to flamewars at the end of every post, endless moderation queues, and bloated, tracking-laden third-party commenting engines. When your readers have something to say, they send you an email, or post a reply on their own blog. </li><li> <strong>No JavaScript</strong>. That’s right: not one line of JavaScript. This means no sneaky tracking. No analytics. No bling. Just words. Words that can be viewed on any device. Words that can be read on an Apple IIe. Words that can be read from command-line, text-based browsers. Words that will stand the test of time. </li><li> <strong>No blurry, bandwidth-hogging stock photos of people in suits drawing on whiteboards.</strong> You can use images in your posts, but you don’t have to fill them up with unneccessary stock photos just so that your theme doesn’t break. A picture is worth a thousands words, but a dozens of photos of people standing around looking slick in a blog post about programming just distracts from what you have to say. </li><li> <strong>No CSS preprocessors</strong>. Sass? Less?? Stylus??? Nope. Just plain old fast, reliable CSS — and not much of it, either. </li><li> <strong>No bloat.</strong> No pretty but ambiguous icons, no fancy fonts that slow down your blog. Your blog will be so fast people can read it over dialup or over a cellphone connection in a blizzard. Which is good, because the people reading it may not live in a coffee shop in San Francisco with blazing fast WiFi. They might live in a village in Nepal, where every byte costs. </li><li> <strong>No multi-author posts.</strong> This theme is for you, sitting by yourself, writing words and putting them on the internet. Large-scale publications have nice themes to pick from; now solo bloggers have one made just for them. </li></ul><hr><p>This doesn’t mean that weblog is backward. It just takes an Amish approach to what is neccesssary. If a feature doesn’t compromise simplicity and speed, weblog probably supports it.</p><ul><li> <strong>Ready for Ghost v2 and beyond.</strong> With weblog, your theme is ready for the future. </li><li> <strong>Super modular.</strong> Weblog makes use of handlebar partials to break things into neat, self-contained modules. Add and remove functionality without code-surgery. </li><li> <strong>Ready-to-roll</strong>. Everything you’d expect from a Ghost theme is built in: A homepage that lists all your posts, author pages, tag pages, navigation menu, subscribe form, metadata, and more. It’s a car with gas in the tank and air in the tires! </li><li> <strong>Smart defaults.</strong> You get a menu with a list of links, a little author bio below each post, reasonable metadata below the title. You get a footer with copyright date and theme attribution. You get all the files that Ghost requires (post page, index, etc) to run, plus all the files a blog needs to be complete (tag and author pages, etc). Nothing fancy, but very respectable. </li><li> <strong>Cleanly coded and comprehensively commented</strong>. The code is nice and clean, and W3C valid. </li><li> <strong>Insanely fast.</strong> Weblog scores "A" on Google pagespeed. The homepage loads in milliseconds. This may be the fastest Ghost theme in the known universe. </li><li> <strong>Rugged beauty.</strong> Weblog has no bling, but the simple design has a rugged beauty of its own: the beauty of function. The beauty of something that has one job, but does it well. </li></ul><p><em>Is this theme too hardcore for your?
